        <ol>
            <li>preheat the oven to 350 degrees.</li>
            <li>cut out a round piece of parchment paper and add to the bottom of two 8-inch round cakepans. grease the insides too.</li>
            <li>whisk flour, salt, and baking powder together in a large mixing bowl and set aside.</li>
            <li>in a saucepan, pour boiling water over 4 tablespoons of earl grey tea leaves and steep for five minutes. after steeping, add heavy cream, stir, and let sit for five minutes.</li>
            <li>in a separate bowl, whisk together sugar, oil, eggs, and vanilla. strain the steeped tea, add to this bowl, and stir again.</li>
            <li>add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and stir until batter is smooth. </li>
            <li>pour half the batter into each cake pan. bake for 40 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean.</li>
            <li>remove and allow to cool completely. for best results, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate until assembly time.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>for the syrup:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>add sugar, water, and tea leaves to a sauce pan.</li>
            <li>simmer until the sugar is dissolved. </li>
            <li>remove from the heat and allow mixture to steep for 10 minutes. strain into a bowl and set aside</li>

        <h3>for the frosting:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>add cream cheese and butter to a bowl and use a stand-mixer to whip for several minutes until creamy.</li>
            <li>on a low speed, add icing sugar, a tablespoon of your syrup, and vanilla.</li>
            <li>after the icing sugar is combined, increase to medium-high speed and whip until light and fluffy</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>assembly time:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>trim the tops of the chilled cakes with a serrated knife until they're flat.</li>
            <li>using a pasty brush, brush the top of the first cake layer with 1-2 tbsps of earl grey syrup.</li>
            <li>add a dollop of icing and spread evenly.</li>
            <li>top with the second cake layer and brush this layer with syrup as well.</li>
